I'm a frontend engineer with high-quality front-end skills. I am currently working as an **SDE-III** at [Atlan](https://atlan.com). I really enjoy making fast, scalable, and interactive web apps which is easy to use. I have experience working with a range of different languages and frameworks and I am always looking for opportunities to work on something new.

Some of my key skills include -  React, NodeJs, MongoDB, Express, Gatsby, NextJs, GSAP, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python and C++
